<p class="green"><span class="first-letter">A</span>nd now, a short aside on intergalactic space and its distances.</p>
<p class="green">&emsp;The sun is (was) never further than fifty-thousand light-years from any other star in the <gax>Milky Way Galaxy</gax>. The distance from the Milky Way to the <gax>Andromeda Galaxy</gax> is over two million light-years, and that's the Milky Way's nearest neighbor. Curiously, because of the universe's wrap-around nature, galaxies can have furthest neighbors just like the stars which they house. The most distant galaxy from our own is called <gax>Polypeteus</gax> and is, roughly speaking, 2 billion billion billion billion billion billion light-years away. Intergalactic space is too large to be comprehended by anyone, but this is fine. So long as one has a competent enough computer to chart a way through the cosmos, the numerical stretches between galaxies need never be intuited, only vaguely grasped. The space between galaxies is totally empty, save for about one stray particle for every cubic meter of nothingness. Lacking inhabitants entirely, it can be perfect for hiding in or dumping garbage into.</p>
<p>&emsp;It's these two <!--It's these obfuscation and trashing-->capabilities that are rivalled only by the cores of inconspicuous suns, where the burning core can be a safe hideway and/or can completely annihilate unwanted stuff of any kind.</p>
<p>&emsp;It would be wrong to say that our Sun is (was) a dumpster fire for aliens who couldn't be bothered to be technologically hygenic.</p>

<p>&emsp;A small green mouse scurried through the assorted metal underbrush of a municipality subdued by rain and dew. It was the night&mdash;overcast&mdash;during a windy season in the cold and dark northern hemisphere of a smallish, damp lump of rock sitting about 120 million miles from its pitiful parent star. Two tiny moons gently hung in the faint gray sky far apart from one another, but their point-like light was blocked effortlessly by the clouds. Humidity slumped over the air like a wet blanket. The planet wasn't well-known for having a large bustling population&mdash;which it lacked&mdash;nor was it renowned for being particularly picturesque &ndash; because it wasn't. It bore the name <name>Coulasda</name>, a name given to it so long ago that its meaning has been forgotten.</p>
<p>&emsp;The planet was, by<!-- almost--> all means, a <!--dull-->sad and uneventful place. With two exceptions: green mice, and an exceptionally strong military prescence, the latter of which is completely unimportant.</p>
<p>&emsp;The mouse&mdash;let's call him Terry&mdash;was now sitting in a cozy little nest of moist scrap metal, silently biting away on a thin lead wire. Three figures strode nearby, prancing on trash-covered pavement which hadn't been dry since it, well, dried. Terry perked his head up, eyeing them with curiosity from behind a chain-link fence. The shortest of the three was articulating excitedly:</p>
<p>&emsp;"Do you know what this means?"<!-- said by Dace, with much hand-motion.--></p>
<p>&emsp;'No.'<!-- Dar imposed, but not so much in a menacing way.--></p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"not really."</span><!-- said Dimm, --></p>
<p>&emsp;"It means we can finally leave!"</p>
<p>&emsp;A sheet of particle board fell through eight stories of dilapidated office building and landed in a pile of mostly springs. This prompted a head-turn from the tallest of the three, but only for a moment. They then went back to looking down at their cartoonishly stout companion, who was, in practical terms, skipping with utter glee<!--joy-->. Terry continued to observe, but he couldn't have actually explained to you what was going on. He only scratched the back of his ear with the middle-left of his six feet, and looked on at the strange people in silence.</p>
<p>&emsp;The three of them, along with many <i>many</i> others, had long since been stuck on the dreary planet, forced to work in the ruthless military research firms of Coulasda. Recently however, Dace (the short and emphatically enthused one) had heard whispers being distilled through the highly-metaphorical grapevine of communication, saying that a long-standing political enemy of the planet had finally been assassinated. And so, as the excited reasoning goes, the military will handily let everyone go home now!</p>
<p>&emsp;Dace believes the reasoning to be completely flawed, of course. That's the whole point of the surprise, and Dace is a huge fan of the technique. They all keep walking. Thunder sounded softly in the distance, and in response, Terry hopped over to a cozy cove of corroded cadmium and curled clockwise for comfort. The iconic triplet of hopestruck aliens came to a halt at a gangly streetlight, distantly in view from the three eyes of a particular green mouse.<!--humble home of a harmful hive.--></p>
<p>&emsp;Dimm sat on the ground. The terrible, wet, poisonous ground. Waterlogged cement does wonders for discomfort.</p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"are you sure?"</span></p><!--"are you sure?"-->
<p>&emsp;"Sure? About what?"</p><!--"Sure? About what?"-->
<p>&emsp;Dimm gesticulated in an irritated way&mdash;a way typical for them&mdash;suggesting that while they're not surprised with this "about what" business, it is received as no less than rather annoying.</p> <!-- dace isn't known for being the sharpest lightbulb in the pickle box -->
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"about us getting let out for no reason."</span></p>
<p>&emsp;"Yes!" Dace shouted, and quickly added, "Yes, look here!"</p>
<p>&emsp;Dimm took a return card from Dace's outstretched hand. The card was first, eyed conspicuously. Then stared at, confusedly.</p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"where the hell did you get this"</span></p>
<p>&emsp;"You know that robotic fellow we managed with a few days ago?"</p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"it managed us..."</span></p>
<p>&emsp;"Same thing, I asked him to make a card for the three of us, and he did! Splendiferous!" Dace giggled, wiggling around with excitement as Dimm turned and overturned the card.</p>
<p>&emsp;Dar suddenly interjected: 'Is that Where Our money Went?'</p><!--what you're referring to as Linux is actually GNU/Linux, or, as i've taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.-->
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"what do you mean by 'went'"</span></p>
<p>&emsp;"Well, he did want some payment in return, and I guess I might've assumed he would ask for a lot anyway......"</p>
<p>&emsp;The extra ellipses (periods) hopefully illustrate that a nervous and generously-sized silence followed. Darmiss, the towering one, turned to face Dace, sitting on the ground and knee-high to a mouse. <span class='green'>(It is a well-known fact that the old Karouscian "Darmiss" is often shortened to just "Dar." The first name's meaning can be translated as, "alike to the stars" while the shorter name simply means "pumpkin" or "cucumber.")</span></p>
<p>&emsp;'So You handed Over 7 kingsransoms?'</p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"how much is that"</span> Dimm interrupted.</p>
<p>&emsp;'All Of It.'</p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"ah,"</span> they lavishly intoned, savoring the syllable of sarcasm. Lifting themself to their feet and strutting around the other two, their voice acquired a smug quality: <span class='aqua'>"dace do you think there's a difference between reedlo and leedlo?"<span></p>
<p>&emsp;"Hey, listen, if I hadn't offered so much up front, he could've started asking questions, or maybe just refuse outright!"</p>
<p>&emsp;'That's A good point.'<p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"pretty lousy good point. what are we going to do in space with no money? take a stroll?"</span></p>
<p>&emsp;The other two thought about this. Dace let his frenetic arms come back down to his lap for a well-deserved rest, and Dar found a dead beetle to stare at. Dimm routed a circle around the other two in an irregular gait for a little while, eventually coming to a stop at the place they began from.</p>
<p>&emsp;Thunder repeated itself from earlier, and this time rain responded. The droplets tapped on the wide-brim hatwear of the three almost-indistinct figures, and the ambient glow of the streetlamp managed a thematically-appropriate flicker. The scene could be colored with a bleak palette, but perhaps that would be a bit disingenuous. Thoughts of pure hope swirled in Dace's mind as he finally decided to continue on with his original train of thought.</p>
<p>&emsp;"Well, I was hoping we could just settle back down on Palathenes and&mdash;"</p>
<p>&emsp;Here, two interruptions occured at the same time:</p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"what"</span> and,</p>
<p>&emsp;'No.' Another roar of thunder emanated from the distance, vaguely in the direction of Terry, but miles away. Dar paused momentarily, partly to think, and partly for dramatic effect. 'Our Only Option there Would be to, As Dimm has pointed Out, "be In space."'</p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"sans money"</span> Dimm quickly added.</p><!--"yeah. that return card just takes us from one garbage dump to another. except we would have the gracious liberty of living abroad the dead vacuum of space."-->
<p>&emsp;"No no no," Dace raved, trying to focus on an important detail. "I only gave him five of our, whatever they're called."</p>
<p>&emsp;'Oh.' said Dar. 'Strange, that. Last I checked We had none Of Our 7.'</p>
<p>&emsp;"But I <u>have</u> the other two right here!" cried Dace, now holding up two large golden pieces of unstamped coinage which were each big enough to serve a whole meal on. The toxic downpour was quick to kindly coat the coins as a matter-of-course.</p>
<p>&emsp;'Why Weren't those In the safepurse?' Dar yelled. 'And Why didn't You say Anything Earlier?'</p>
<p>&emsp;Quietly, and with a touch of guilt, Dace whimpered: "I wanted to hold onto them for safekeeping. And I forgot, okay?"</p>
<p>&emsp;A moment of silence slipped by the derailed conversation, stealing the show for a record 5.3 seconds, after which Dimm immediately focused eye-attention towards that beetle from earlier, oblivious that Dar had already squared that away. They glared at it as if with a cynicism strong enough to travel backwards in time and kill, say, a small insect.<!--flogged the late insect.--></p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"two would only barely be enough, assuming gold still carries weight back home"</span> they said. The beetle, were it alive and capable of grasping these things, would've pittied the whole dilemma, obviously.</p>
<p>&emsp;The rain beat heavier... and louder. <!--Occasionally the three observed shards of crystal sleuthing with the rain, with the rouse broken after smashing-->The downpour was speckled with crystal raindrops which smashed against the ground and shattered into mist. And sometimes <i>those</i> slammed right into their stylish hats, erupting violent pops of glittery and hazardous material that could've easily killed your average uninitiated lifeform &ndash; which excludes the lifeforms of Coulasda. The thunder crashed in drunken waves all around them, levelling out the listenable noises and sluicing them for a sleuthed trio of shouting voices, desperately trying not to drown in the violent and virulent weather.</p> <!-- torrential downpour* -->
<p>&emsp;Dar shouted at the torrent: 'Wouldn't it be Weightless In space?'</p>
<p>&emsp;"What?" said Dace, cupping one ear.</p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"shut up, listen, the fact of the matter is that we have some money and we have&mdash;"</span> they held up the card so both could see, <span class='aqua'>"&mdash;the means."</span> Despite their muted voice, their tones seemed to ring over the rain to their colleagues.</p>
<p>&emsp;A cricket-like thing the size of a mini-van lolloped into a streetlamp about five yards from the three of them. It screeched and quickly jumped away into the midnight-dark wind, unnoticed.</p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"we've got to use the card"</span></p>
<p>&emsp;Dar thinks. Going home, really? After all this time? And what if this landmark decision is an unexpected sealing of three coffins? Anything could go wrong here&mdash;Dar concentrates hard&mdash;if they're noticed at any moment along the path... possibly even a robot could detect something amiss...</p>
<p>&emsp;On the other hand, what would they be condemned to for passing up this opportunity? Dar knows this wasn't always a militant and dangerous planet, but it certainly is now... more often than not you get surprised by the people who don't disappear...</p>
<p>&emsp;'I concur.'</p>
<p>&emsp;"Yay! I can't wait to see how my saewer is doing!"</p>
<p>&emsp;Dimm would rather end on a note of exasperation: <span class='aqua'>"dace, i just wanted to say,"</span></p>
<p>&emsp;Dace bolted his head in the direction of Dimm, holding a glass-shatteringly utmost expectancy in his small glowing eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;<span class='aqua'>"i find it absolutely inconceivable that after realizing the safety of our lives is in jeopardy, you have the audacity to single-handedly <i>make it worse,</i> shortly before surprising us with a ludicrous scheme of survival cloaked in an inappropriate trenchcoat of joy and celebration. i can't decide if you're overly optimistic or actually demented."</span></p>
<p>&emsp;"Whatever that means, I agree."</p>
<hr style="border:revert;height:0px;">
<p>&emsp;It is said that many things are said of the public transport system. In a system that concerns this story, three escapees on board is in fact not out-of-place. They were sat as inconspicuously as could be achieved, snugly tripled-up on the right side of the middle of the cabin. There was a robotic flight attendant at the front-end of the room, who at this point was notifying the passengers that the empty space above had been cleared for departure, and if anyone should decide that they really do want to stay actually, now would be a most pleasant time to do so.</p>
<p>&emsp;And so they clambered up and out of the zephyrean patchwork of Coulasda's excessively rainy atmosphere. There are places on the planet where it almost never rains, of course. People don't get put in those climates for the simple reason that it wouldn't be soul-crushing enough. Incidentally, Coulasda now requires that all sheltered slums on the planet must be checked for dreariness with a calibrated soulcrushometer before being approved for the workforce. Any region where the clouds can be differentiated from the horizon are immediately disqualified.</p>
<p>&emsp;Hence, wow! Clouds!</p>
<p>&emsp;And after clouds, the hazy fade of the gray atmosphere. And after that, hundreds of brilliantly shining points...</p>
<p>&emsp;Dace beamed his point-like peepers through the window for the whole trip. It's Palathenes or nothing.</p>
