<p><span class="first-letter">E</span>very day Aven Wry would get out of bed and immediately wonder why they had done so.</p>
<p class="green">&emsp;The equation which describes the entire universe takes about one hundred thousand symbols to write out in fully-expanded form and as such requires several books to be carried around in. The reason for this complexity is completely unknown and has been left to the considerations of amateur philosophers and philosophy students. The scientists who did the working out and proving of what is now known, thanks to Khan McWay, as the Everything Equation were, and indeed still are, extremely irritated. When the last pieces of the equation began to tediously fall into place at the Grand Milk University, a number of physicists present in the room began to realize that the solution would look more than a little messy, and had planned to burn the entire university down before the final derivation was complete. Their efforts to hinder the discovery would've been in vain of course, which is what they realized right before they planned to set fire to several hundred tons of meticulously hidden explosives, fireworks, gas cans, flasks of ethanol, phone books, and really just about anything they could find that would light. Some abandonded science forever, citing a lack of creativity on the part of reality, and went on to persue art or politics instead. Others insisted that there was still work to do, saying that "just because we have the answers, does not mean we have the questions."</p>
<p>&emsp;A familiar voice called from downstairs. It was of Aven's roommate Kathy (pronounced Kaythie) Burrows, who had just finished breakfast and was now calling to make sure that Aven hadn't tumbled out of bed and passed out on the floor, as they were oft to do unsupervised.</p>
<p>&emsp;"Aven!" She shouted. "Are you awake?"</p>
<p>&emsp;And as was the case with all days that started like this one, Aven would mutter something incoherent and begin a long and slow trudge to downstairs, rubbing their eyes and looking as if in a daze. Aven had much to do today, and could be forgiven for thinking that all that needed doing was infact doable with ample time, or enough time at all really. The reason they could be forgiven, of course, was that while this day had started <u>like</u> all the others had, it hadn't started <u>as</u> all the others had. Nobody, not Aven or Kathy, not any scientist or world leader<!-- the landlord or the president-->, not a single person knew that the sun had been detonated almost the exact moment this thought had popped into Aven's head. Actually, it would've been remarkable if anyone had figured that out before the planets began evaporating. It is this fact which goes rather against their carefree mindset about time-spending. None of this occured to Aven, and they strode through the hallway leading to the kitchen and from the stairs in blissful, if drowsy, ignorance.</p>
<p>&emsp;Earth had eight minutes left.</p>
<p>&emsp;Reaching the dining room, Aven slumped distractedly onto a chair.</p>
<p>&emsp;"Want an orange?" suggested Kathy. She had already cut one into slices and put it in front of the seat Aven now happened to be sitting at. No response, though a hand reached for a slice of orange. It was Aven's. They nibbled and chewed on the slice in a noncomprehending so-so sort of way, and quietly regarded the fruit with a sense of fondness. Seven minutes.</p>
<p>&emsp;"Have any dreams last night?" asked Kathy.</p>
<p>&emsp;"No," came an unemphatic response. Then, "none which I remember."</p>
<p>&emsp;"Ah," she said, and paused, then continued: "I had a dream about you."</p>
<p>&emsp;By this point Aven was fully-awake and halfway through a second slice of orange when they nearly swallowed incorrectly. Kathy <i>was</i> the type of person to talk about her dreams somewhat often, but historically that had never involved themself personally. They allowed a small amount of time to think about this, which turned out to be not ample enough time at all.</p>
<p>&emsp;Not meeting her gaze, Aven voiced a perplexed and drawn-out "What?" which was the only thing they could even manage to vaguely intone.</p>
<p>&emsp;Kathy was a dreamer. She caught the stars in the glints of her eyes. For as long as Aven had known her, dreams had been one of her many consistent joys and passions in life. For as long as she had known herself, this was also true. And while it was reasonable enough for her to enjoy dreaming and aspects of dreaming such as journaling dreams, cataloging them, ruminating on the possibility of hidden meaning, and so forth; it was totally unreasonable for her to be dreaming what she was dreaming. Every dream she has ever recalled has, by some perversion of luck, turned out to eventually predict the future&mdash;and not without uncanny precision. There's absolutely no mechanism behind this; it's really just a string of massive coincidences. To everyone who knows her well, this is hardly news. And while no one has managed a plausible explanation for her premonitions, her thoughts tend to sway decisions and opinions quite heavily if ever she mentions that she had seen something in a dream. This she was often reluctant to do, precisely because it felt to her as so unfair to anyone else involved.</p>
<p>&emsp;At any rate, if Kathy Burrows dreams about something, tells you about it, and even goes so far as to say that it involves you personally in some way, then you may want to remove a piece of fruit from your throat and take an idyllic vacation for a couple of days. You may now sympathize with a suddenly apprehensive Aven, who, now mere minutes from the earth's destruction, is not wealthy enough to spend that much time. A small amount of time is the only thing which can fit this demanding budget.
<p>&emsp;Now, finally, she goes on:</p>
<p>&emsp;"All I can remember," Kathy began, and a cloy smile found its way to her face, which unsettled Aven greatly, "is hearing you say 'why is all the grass on fire' and then being enveloped by a blinding light."</p>
<p>&emsp;"Please stop smiling."</p>
<p>&emsp;She stopped smiling. "I wonder if this will be the first time I get it wrong."</p>
<p>&emsp;"Maybe," they looked up at a clock on the wall, which read 9:54. "What time did the clock show?"</p>
<p>&emsp;"Ten exactly," she said. "That's six minutes."</p>
<p>&emsp;Aven made a sound which could be described as an agreeing mumble. It was totally conceivable, they thought, that she was absolutely correct, and that something mysterious and possibly cataclysmic would occur before they got through the last of the orange. An idea popped into their head.</p>
<p>&emsp;"How many slices of orange had I finished eating?" inquired Aven.</p>
<p>&emsp;"Three." retorted Kathy.</p>
<p>&emsp;"Watch this," and they inexpertly wolfed down two additional slices, bringing the tally total to four. They boasted unenthusiastically: "Now we watch your prophecy crumble." Unbenounced to Aven&mdash;and in fact Kathy would come to never bring it up later&mdash;she had completely lied; in her dream there were four slices eaten and four remaining. She would've admitted that she thought herself to be quick and cunning, even if lying was completely unnecessary; mysterious dream fate is unshakable.</p>
<p>&emsp;For a while they waited. The clock on the wall ticked softly to itself, counting seconds like an expectant fisherman with the rhythm and pomp of a brain surgeon. A shockwave of light-energy slowly, yet surely, was shuffling through the empty space between the earth and what had been the sun. It wouldn't be long now. Soon it would come crackling down into the mostly-unsuspecting planet below.</p>
<p>&emsp;"Well at least if I'm right we probably won't have to worry about doing anything important today." said Kathy reassuringly.</p>
<p>&emsp;"Are you betting that we're going to die?" said Aven dryly.</p>
<p>&emsp;"I said we <i>probably</i> won't have to worry."</p>
<p>&emsp;"...meaning we're <i>probably</i> going to die?"</p>
<p>&emsp;"Yes. I guess so. Only if I'm right."</p>
<p>&emsp;"You've never been wrong."</p>
<p>&emsp;She paused to ponder this for a short while, and began pacing around by the large windows of the kitchen room.</p>
<hr style="border:revert;height:0px;">
<p>&emsp;The hands struck ten with the booming fanfare of breathless anticipation<!--silent fanfare-->. <!--After about twenty seconds of staring at the blissfully-unaware clock, -->Twenty seconds crept through the underbrush of the present moment without even the slightest hint of world-ending doom. It was after those twenty seconds, though, that the gnarled sharp-edges of fate took hold of the planet Earth.</p>
<p>&emsp;The sky paled. Aven pondered aloud at why the ground outside was burning. And then, not even a second after they were finished talking, the ground, the room, and the people, were gone.</p>
<p>&emsp;Earth was blanketed in cosmic death...</p>
<p>&emsp;Pluto stood vigil guard of the Outer Wall of the City of Death. Inside was everything which had once lived, and then some. Locked away as part of an eternal archival program, the denizen-prisoners of the City went about their no-longer-lives in either one of two ways: quiet contemplation, or&mdash;and this was the prevailing case&mdash;abject terror.</p>
<p>&emsp;Approaching the gates to the Inner City, Pluto distractedly maneuvered a bony hand into one of his many satchels and pulled out of it a strange talisman which looked not unlike a clipboard. It was indeed a clipboard after a certain fashion, and he flipped through it at an unappreciatedly astounding pace, checking all entries marked for a planet called "Earth". Satisfied with his attention to detail and his caution to attention, he tilted his head toward the satchel he had reached from and, thrusting the clipboard back inside, strode over towards the ever-moving stream of people, organisms, and entities who were always being funneled into the gates, with no signs of their number ever letting up.</p>
<p>&emsp;His tired gaze fixed on a pair of individuals standing five places in line from entering the City's foreboding gateway. Calmly, he pulled them both aside and said, in a slow and broken-up mode of voice, "You two aren't supposed to be here... right now."</p>
