she walks 'round the block
with her hands in her pock
-ets, half-past their bedtimes
but her rite's still: writes right rhymes
patient and focused;
she's in her element,
she's in her period, she's
group, block, and table-zen
stop!...
let her begin again:

and starry rivers met ford
some hundred years, or more
and whisked petals from out under her feet
they tore pages from gardens
and science from fiction
and god damn them- they made me

dubbe dill
dubbe dill
no one understands her
her quillbook reflects her self, still
dubbe dill

she sets her own scene
makes it ugly and mean
she swears; says she's sorry
she thinks, swears it's sorry cry-
stal clear just who she is
when it comes around again
two by three, forty-three
count on her forgetting
not,
and she continues on:

deigned you are by thy god
my own soul your own rod
normally, these things are true
but i tore more pages
and learned from dark mages
i know now- the illness is you!

dubbe dill
dubbe dill
no one understands her
her quillbook reflects her still, will
dubbe dill

friends say her mind may be shot
in hers she churns love from rot
she paces and screams, worry
-ing aint what she loved... this for
fury and aimlessness;
not her skill, nor her sense
stern and with drive,
she comes back every time
though, she,
sighs twice and so:

my friends saw my mind is
shot like a light when it's
down on its little last knees

i've waited all for this time
spring come bloom, winter die
nothing means more to me right now

but home come no hove
know numb, bitter, home
is it my fault or is it thine?

because i ripped out pages
from under your sole!
i see now, the illness- it's mine.

dubbe dill
dubbe dill
just one understands her
her quillbook reflects not her, will
dubbe dill

dubbe dill
dubbe dill
finally now one now knows her
and no one shall ask her that
she, be
dubbed, ill
